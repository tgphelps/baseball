The definition file contains the following lines, in any order.
The lines will be read completely before doing any work.

Each line is a sequence of fields, separated by whitespace. Fields
will be separated by split(), so there can be no embedded white space
within a field.

Blank lines are ignored.
Lines started with '#' are comments and wil be ignored.

The first field defines the format of the rest of the line. The various
line formats are below:

table <table name>
primary_key <column>...

# There should be one 'col' line for each CSV field. It defines the
# type of the column ('i' => int, 's' => string) and the name of
# the column in the SQL table:

col <number> <type> <SQL column name>


Sample SQL:

CREATE TABLE example (
    a integer,
    b integer,
    c integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (a, c)
);
